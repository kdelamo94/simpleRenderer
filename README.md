##Installation and Dependencies

This project depends on both PyGame and PyOpenGL meaning these need to be
installed in order for the test.py script to run as expected.

Installation of these on a Linux based machine is simple and is explained here
for PyGame and here for PyOpenGL.

For a Windows based machine, Pygame provides instructions for installation,
while PyOpenGL is best handled [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
 for windows.
